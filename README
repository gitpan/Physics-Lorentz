NAME
    Physics::Lorentz - Package for 4-vectors and transformations

SYNOPSIS
      use Physics::Lorentz;
      my $rotation = Physics::Lorentz::Transformation->rotation_euler(
        $alpha, $beta, $gamma
      );
      my $vector = Physics::Lorentz::Vector->new([$t, $x, $y, $z]);
      my $rotated = $rotation->apply($vector);
      # or: $rotated = $rotation * $vector;
  
      ...

DESCRIPTION
    This package mainly just loads Physics::Lorentz::Transformation and
    Physics::Lorentz::Vector. The whole of the "Physics::Lorentz"
    distribution is intended to help with dealing with 4-vectors and
    (Poincare) transformations in the associated vector space.

    Vectors and transformations are implemented as PDL objects internally.

  EXPORT
    None.
